 * Due date: Thursday, July 23 10:00pm.

* Submission process: Follow the submission instructions on the final page. Make sure you do not remove any `\newpage` tags or rename this file, as this will break the submission.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
# Don't change these lines, just run them!
source("setup/lab05.RAGS.R")
```

Helpful hints:

- Every function you need to use was taught during lecture! So you may need to 
revisit the lecture code to help you along by opening the relevant files on Datahub. 
Alternatively, you may wish to view the code in the condensed PDFs posted 
on the course website. Good luck!

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and 
paste code for the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to 
diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting! We recommend 
knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code 
chunk, so you can detect the source of knitting errors more easily. This will 
save you and the GSIs from frustration! **You must knit correctly before submitting.**

- If your code runs off the page of the knitted PDF then you will LOSE POINTS! To
avoid this, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the 
file (you can easily view it on Gradescope via the provided link after submitting). 
If it doesn't look right, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using 
the return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

### Instructions

Part 1 of this lab focuses on calculating probability of independent events.

### Section I: Breakout Problems on Independence

## Blood Type

**From Baldi and Moore (3E question 10.28, 4E question 10.30)**
  All human blood can be one of the following types: O, A, B, or AB,
but the distribution of types varies a bit among groups of people.  
Here are the distributions of blood types for a randomly chosen person in China and in the United States:
  
Check out the following table:
  
  |       |  $O$ |  $A$ |  $B$ |  $AB$ | 
  |-------|------|------|------|-------|
  |China  |  0.35|  0.27|  0.26|   0.12| 
  |U.S.   |  0.45|  0.40|  0.11|   0.04|   
  
  
  
Choose an American person and a Chinese person at random, independently of each other.

**3. [1 point] From Baldi and Moore (3E question 10.29, 4E not present)**
  
  _Universal blood donors._  
People with type O-negative blood are universal donors.  
That is, any patient can receive a transfusion of type O-negative blood.  
Only 7.2 % of the American population have O-negative blood.  
If 10 people appear at random to give blood, what is the probability that at least 1 of them is a universal donor?

\newpage

**From Baldi and Moore (3E question 10.46, 4E not present)**
  
  _Mendelian inheritance._ 

Some traits of plants and animals depend on inheritance of a single gene.  
This is called _Mendelian inheritance_, after Gregor Mendel (1822-1884).
Each of us has an ABO blood type, which describes whether two characteristics called A and B are present.  
Every human being has two blood type alleles (gene forms), one inherited from our mother and one from our father.  
Each of these alleles can be A, B, or O.  Which two we inherit determines our blood type.  
Here is a table that shows what our blood type is for each combination of two alleles.

|Alleles inherited   | 	Blood type|
  |--------------------|------------|
  |	A and A            |           A|
  |	A and B	           |			    AB|
  |	A and O	           |			     A|
  |	B and B	           |           B|
  |	B and O	           |		    	 B|
  |	O and O	           |     			 O|
  
  We inherent each of a parent’s two alleles with probability  .50,
and we inherit independently from our mother and our father.


Punnett squares are used in genetics courses to organize these sorts of information.
The alleles for one parent label the row and for the other parent label the columns.

**6. [1 point] If Jasmine and Tyrone have three children, what is the probability that all three have blood type O?	What is the probability that the first child has blood type O and the next two do not?**
  
The next calculations assume that they do not have any twins or triplets, 
so that each child is independent.

## The Flu

**7. [2 points] From Baldi and Moore (2E question 10.20 to 10.23)**
  
  The November 2009 Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index survey asked a random sample of 28,606 American adults whether they had the flu on the day before the interview.  Here are the results by age group:
  |age group |		flu| 		no flu|	  total|
  |----------|-------|----------|--------|
  | 18 to 29 |		 88|	   2,486|   2,574|
  |	30 to 44 |		132|	   5,162|   5,294|
  |	45 to 64 |		276|		11,733|  12,009|
  |	65+      |	  122|	   8,607|	  8,729|
  |total     |	  618|		27,988|  28,606|
  
  The events  "adult is in a specified age group" and "adult has the flu" are called **independent** if the probability of flu does not vary across the age groups.

The conditional probabilities of flu among those age 65 and older _________ and flu among those 18 to 29 years old _________. 
Compare the probability of flu among those age 65 and older and the probability of flu among those 18 to 29 years old.


[ TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE ]
  

This shows that the events "age group" and "adult has the flu" are **not** independent.
Another way to check for independence is to see if the overall probability of flu differs from the age-group stratum specific probabilities of flu. Do this, too.

## Testing for HIV 

**From Baldi and Moore (question 10.14)**
  
  
  Enzyme immunoassay tests are used to screen blood specimens for the
presence of antibodies to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Antibodies indicate the presence of
the virus. The test is quite accurate but is not always correct. Here are approximate
probabilities of positive and negative test results when the blood tested does and does not
actually contain antibodies to HIV. [Hint: these are conditional probabilities, given HIV status.]

* P( test positive + | antibodies present ) = 0.9985
* P( test positive + | antibodies absent ) = 0.0060
* P( test negative – | antibodies present ) = 0.0015
* P( test negative – | antibodies absent ) = 0.9940

Suppose that 1% of a large population carries antibodies to HIV in its blood.

**8. [1 point] Draw a tree diagram representing the HIV status if a person from this population (outcomes: antibodies present or absent) and the blood test result (outcomes: test positive or test negative).**

(Use the code chunk below to include an image file of your drawing. To do so you 
need to delete the hashtag, upload the image to Datahub into the `src` directory and replace the file name with your file name. JPG or PNG will both work.)

### Section 2: Normal Distribution

Part 2 of this lab introduces the normal distribution.

Notation reminder: Baldi and Moore use a compact notation for specifying that a population has a distribution that follows a normal curve with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ : N( $\mu$ , $\sigma$ )

R Functions Reminder: `qnorm` takes a probability as its input and gives back a value on the distribution (aka a z-score if the distribution is N(0,1)). By default, it assumes the probability area you enter (as a decimal, not a percent) is the area below (or less than) the z score you need.  The `pnorm` function takes a  z value or and X value as its input and gives back a probability area. 

**Question 1. Z scores. **
  (From Baldi and Moore, 3E question 11.27, 4E question 11.29) 
Use R to find the standardized value z that satisfies each of the following conditions. In each case, sketch a standard Normal curve with your value of z marked on the axis.
\newpage
**14. [1 point]	The probability is 0.8 that a randomly selected observation falls below z.**  
```{r Section II Q1a}
p1 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p1
check_problem14()
```

\newpage 
**15. [1 point]	The probability is 0.35 that a randomly selected observation falls above z.** 
```{r Section II Q1b}
p2 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p2
check_problem15()
```

**Full-Term Birth Weights (From Baldi and Moore, 3E question 11.31, 4E question 11.33) **

For babies born at full term (37 to 39 completed weeks of gestation), the distribution of birth weight (in grams) is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 3350 grams and a standard deviation of 440 grams, N(3350,440).


**16. [1 point] What is the 25th percentile of the birthweights for full term babies?** 
  
```{r Section II Q2a}
p3 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p3
check_problem16()
```

**17. [1 point] What is the 90th percentile of the birthweights for full term babies?** 
  
```{r Section II Q2b}
p4 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p4
check_problem17()
```


**18. [1 point] What is the range of the middle 50% of birthweights for full term babies? **
  
```{r Section II Q2c}
p5 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p5
check_problem18()
```


**Late Pre-Term Birth Weights (From Baldi and Moore, 3E question 11.32, 4E question 11.34)** 

How much difference do a couple of weeks make for birthweight? Late preterm babies are born with 35 to 37 weeks completed of gestation. The distribution of birth weight (in grams) or late preterm babies is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 2750 grams and a standard deviation of 560 grams,  N(2750,560).


**19. [1 point] What is the 25th percentile of the birthweights for late-preterm term babies?** 
```{r Section II Q3a}
p6 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p6
check_problem19()
```


**20. [1 point] What is the 90th percentile of the birthweights for late-preterm babies?**
  
```{r Section II Q3b}
p7 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p7
check_problem20()
```



**21. [1 point] What is the range of the middle 50% of birthweights for late-preterm babies?**
```{r Section II Q3c}
p8 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p8
check_problem21()
```


**22. [1 point] Compare your answers to the parts of full term babies to late-preterm babies. What do you notice?**

**Question 5. Newborn Respirations. (From Baldi and Moore, 3E questions 11.15-11.17, 4E question 11.17-11.19)**

**23. [1 point]** The respiratory rate per minute in newborns varies according to a distribution that is approximately Normal with mean 50 and standard deviation 5.
The probability (convert to a percentage and round to two decimal places) that a randomly chosen newborn has a respiratory rate of 55 per minute or more is approximately:
```{r Section II Q5a}
p9 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p9
check_problem23()
```

**24. [1 point]** The probability (convert to a percentage and round to two decimal places) that a randomly chosen newborn has a respiratory rate per minute between 40 and 55 is approximately: 
```{r Section II Q5b}
p10 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p10
check_problem24()
```

**Drosophila (From Baldi and Moore, 3E questions 11.20 and 11.22, 4E question 11.23)**

The common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is the most studied organism in genetic research because it is small, easy to grow, and reproduces rapidly. The length of the thorax (where the wings and legs attach) in a population of male fruit flies is approximately Normal with mean 0.800 millimeters (mm) and standard deviation 0.078 mm.

**25. [1 point]**	Choose a male fruit fly at random. The probability (convert to a percentage and round to two decimal places) that the fly you choose has a thorax longer than 1 mm is about:
  
```{r Section II Q6a}
p11 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p11
check_problem25()
```


**Z scores. (From Baldi and Moore, 3E question 11.25, 4E question 11.27)**

Use R’s pnorm function to find the proportion of observations from a standard Normal distribution that fall in each of the following regions. In each case, sketch a standard Normal curve and shade the area representing the region.

**26. [1 point]**	z $\le$ -2.25
```{r Section II Q7a}
p12 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p12
check_problem26()
```


**27. [1 point]**	z $\ge$ -2.25

```{r Section II Q7b}
p13 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p13
check_problem27()
```

**28. [1 point]**	z > 1.77

```{r Section II Q7c}
p14 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p14
check_problem28()
```

**29. [1 point]** -2.25 < z < 1.77

```{r Section II Q7d}
p15 <- "<<<<YOUR ANSWER HERE>>>>"
p15
check_problem29()
```
